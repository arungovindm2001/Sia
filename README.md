<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The idea came to us from some previous projects about making a browser extension that could automate the stuff and make surfing an awesome experience. There are lot of people that get scammed everyday due to opening malicious links or get cyberbullied online and they don't that's actually happening. People with dyslexia can't read things on browsers properly or we don't want to really read a whole site to gain some information but would like it if were read to us. For all these problems and more Sia was built.

### Built With

* [JavaScript]()
* [NumPy]()
* [Pandas]()
